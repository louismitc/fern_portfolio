yo, it's my current portfolio! based on [fernfolio](https://fernfolio.netlify.app/) by tyler m. boderick using [eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) and [netlify cms](https://www.netlifycms.org/).

it has full support for netlify cms, uses markdown for content and nunjucks for layouts (mmm, sexy) and has no javascript framework (hot)
