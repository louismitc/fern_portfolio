Hi there, thanks for checking out my portfolio. I’m Louis, I’m 20, and I’m a video & content producer, editor and social strategist.

What’s a Social Strategist, you might ask. Basically, I’m pretty good at working out how you can get your message out to your target audience. I specialise in digital climate communications, focussing on the Gen-Z age group. I’m on top of the latest trends, and know what content will draw people in.

Youth movements and non-profits are my strength. I’ve worked extensively with digital communications in youth climate groups such as School Strike 4 Climate and Fridays For Future, other non-profits such as Climate Live, plus social enterprises such as Curv.

Video and content that makes people engage and feel something is my passion. Whether that be a launch video, a campaign announcement, or just a general video to share an update to your supporters, I’m skilled at making sure that you can get that message out to the people who need to see it. I can help in any stage of the process - whether that be planning, scripting, production, editing, or campaigning, I’m keen to help.

#### skills

Through my work in social media communications, I’ve managed to get good at a few things. I’m great at working through content planning, in both the long and short term.

From a production perspective, I’m great at storyboarding, scripting, production logistics, and most parts of post production. I also used to work in music production so I’m pretty good at anything music/audio related for your projects.

I’m great at managing Twitter, Instagram and TikTok accounts, and am proficient in their respective analytical analysis tools.

#### software skills

I’m proficient in video editing in both Davinci Resolve and Premiere Pro, and I’m currently learning both Blender and After Effects for 2D and 3D animation. From a graphical perspective, I’m great at Photoshop and know my way around Illustrator. I’m a very quick learner and mess around with programs a lot, so if you or your team use different software, don’t hesitate to contact me - I may know it already or be keen to learn.
