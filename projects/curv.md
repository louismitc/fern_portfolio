[Curv](joincurv.com) is a social media network designed from the ground up to push for action on social issues, while also supporting user's mental health and wellbeing. 

After initially working with Curv on a pro-bono basis to create video content and advise their social strategy in early 2022, I came on to join their team full-time working as a video & content producer, as well as working on movement support. Working remotely, I was tasked with fully producing video content for both Curv as a company, but also for movements that utilised Curv to allow them to grow and thrive, as well as lead Curv‚Äôs external social media communications strategy. The focus was almost always not on advancing Curv as a brand, but rather supporting the movements and social causes represented on Curv, which would result in platform growth.

Working as part of this team allowed me to not only continue to improve in my skills in video production within a fast paced environment, but the ‚Äúall hands on deck‚Äù work culture allowed me to improve my skills in graphic design, web design & development, UI & UX, systems management, and online and offline marketing. It was also incredible to work with and support a wide variety of movements in predominantly social change and climate spaces who were making a genuine impact, as a part of my job. 

Almost all video work I completed for Curv, and all videos within this page, were completed independently from pitch to delivery by myself. 

### Movement Collaborations

My work with Curv allowed me to work closely with movements (often grassroots) to develop and produce content that furthered their campaigns, reducing internal workload. The above video was created for the Stop Rosebank campaign to use as part of their digital day of action targeting the fossil fuel giant Equinor, where the primary strategy was to bombard their offices with phone calls. It was designed for release on both TikTok and Instagram. 

### Story Driven Content

#### Stockholm+50 Climate Conference

While Curv is a social media startup, its purpose to support movements allowed me to cover major events in social causes, such as Stockholm+50, a major climate conferenced organised by UNEP to ‚Äúcelebrate‚Äù 50 years since the first UN environmental conference that established UNEP. I had the opportunity to interview and collaborate with other activists to create an engaging summary of the conference.

#### Swedish Elections

In 2022, while living I was living in Sweden, the Swedish elections resulted in a party with concerning nazi roots being elected as the second largest party in parliament. Through Curv, I was able to create an impactful video explaining the impacts and ramifications of this result. This involved detailed and careful research while navigating a sensitive topic, interviewing dozens of Swedish citizens, activists and experts to ensure that the reporting was an accurate representation of progressive views on the ground.  

### Consistent Video Output

Throughout 2022, I produced a weekly social media segment for Curv showcasing some of the best content on the platform. While I learnt a lot from the production of these videos, honing in my speed editing, motion graphics skills, and scripting, a major learning was knowing when to stop - the series was discontinued on my recommendation to allow for the production of more impactful and meaningful content.
