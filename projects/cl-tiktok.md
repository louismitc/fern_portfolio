### Task
I was tasked on a few occasions to create social content for Climate Live‚Äôs TikTok page.

#### Edited TikToks

After a substantial hiatus on TikTok and with an upcoming lineup announcement, I was tasked with creating the above TikTok to re-energise our feed and create hype around the lineup announcement. I formulated, developed and edited this TikTok by myself, but also work with a co-organiser to provide filmed content as seen in the opening of the video. This TikTok involved sourcing a lot of B-Roll footage and images to use, very sharp editing to ensure that the content changes lined up with the music, and some usage of effects. I also had to create mock ups and explainers when working with the co-organiser for the opening section, so that the content they provided fitted in with timing of the TikTok. This TikTok currently has more than 13k views.

#### Live TikTok Production

I created this TikTok at the Climate Live event in Stockholm, Sweden. While it seems simple at face value, it required some prior planning with live production teams, event organisers and social media teams to ensure that the filming and posting went smoothly (this included getting backup angles if anything went wrong, and liaising with producers to ensure that shots were not blocked). As we knew that Greta rickrolling an audience at an event live-streamed to multiple major outlets had a high chance of going viral, we knew we had to work quick to be the first up with a TikTok to capitalise on the virality of the moment. The TikTok was posted about 5 minutes after the rickroll occurred, and now has more that 4 million views. It was also picked up by major outlets including BBC News, BRUT Media, ITV and Storyful (I  managed all media requests in relation to the TikTok).
