### Task
With the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, many events that had previously been solely in person had to move online. One such event was the Childrenâ€™s Book Council of Australia. While being the prominent award council for childrenâ€™s literature, they had not yet seen a need for the use of video content as there was never a need. With the impossibility of an in person event for their 2020 shortlist announcement however, there was a sudden need to change this.

### Solution

I was brought on with extremely limited time left until the award event was scheduled to take place, as the sole video producer. Immediately I worked with the CBCA team to develop a structure for the event and worked to script, source talent and collect content in a collaborative setting.

We decided to use past winners and well known childrenâ€™s authors to present the shortlist. While each section of the ceremony had specific points that needed to be covered, and of course the announcement of the shortlisted books, we asked that the authors bring their own personal charm to each segment, rather than fully script the entire ceremony.

Due to the tight timeframe, I used simple graphical elements and music. I consulted and collaborated with the CBCA executives to find the right branding for the ceremony that fit in with their strategy and intended audience.

Iâ€™m quite happy with how this project turned out given the tight time circumstances. It currently has over 12,000 views on YouTube and received significant praise within the industry.
