I worked with Climate Live, first as a volunteer and later as a paid coordinator, between January 2020 and June 2022, and later as a video contractor on a freelance basis. Throughout this time I primarily worked in content and media production, honing my skills that I use professionally today. I've summarised some of my work across vertical and horizontal short-form content below.

### Video Production
#### April Fools Day 2021
With Climate Live holding events in April, there was a need to boost engagement and draw more attention to Climate Live. I pitched and developed an video to coincide with April Fools day. At the time, Climate Live‚Äôs social media ran at a tight schedule, so I was only given 2 days to flesh out a concept, write and edit something together.

The pitch was to present blasting the song ‚ÄúAll Star‚Äù by Smash Mouth into the atmosphere as a reasonable way to solve the climate crisis. Due to the tight timeframe I had to use pretty rudimentary editing techniques, as I also had to learn how to use Blender 2D to create the earth and sun graphics (I‚Äôm now much better at using that). I think it turned out pretty well, and was a fun way to start a pretty stressful month.

#### Sweden Events Launch
I was contracted by Climate Live Sweden to produce a short 20-30 second video to announce their upcoming 2022 event series. Content and copy was supplied, so the task was to creatively utilise this copy and the large amount of content to create an engaging series of ads.

After a substantial hiatus on TikTok and with an upcoming lineup announcement, I was tasked with creating the above TikTok to re-energise our feed and create hype around the lineup announcement. I formulated, developed and edited this TikTok by myself, but also work with a co-organiser to provide filmed content as seen in the opening of the video. This TikTok involved sourcing a lot of B-Roll footage and images to use, very sharp editing to ensure that the content changes lined up with the music, and some usage of effects. I also had to create mock ups and explainers when working with the co-organiser for the opening section, so that the content they provided fitted in with timing of the TikTok. This TikTok currently has more than 13k views.

I created this TikTok at the Climate Live event in Stockholm, Sweden. While it seems simple at face value, it required some prior planning with live production teams, event organisers and social media teams to ensure that the filming and posting went smoothly (this included getting backup angles if anything went wrong, and liaising with producers to ensure that shots were not blocked). As we knew that Greta rickrolling an audience at an event live-streamed to multiple major outlets had a high chance of going viral, we knew we had to work quick to be the first up with a TikTok to capitalise on the virality of the moment. The TikTok was posted about 5 minutes after the rickroll occurred, and now has more that 4 million views. It was also picked up by major outlets including BBC News, BRUT Media, ITV and Storyful, which involved work to manage media requests.
